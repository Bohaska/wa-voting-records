<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

Reaffirming that a nation&#146;s retirement or dissolution does not nullify their former accomplishments, 

Nevertheless concerned that Security Council Resolution #466, &#147;Commend Hulldom,&#148; does not withstand scrutiny, as it relies on accomplishments that have not stood the test of time, rely on incomplete or shaky facts, or have been contravened by the nation&#146;s subsequent acts,

Questioning the commendation&#146;s citations of mentored General Assembly authors on the basis that these nations participated in the body independent of any involvement on Hulldom&#146;s part, mere introductions of others to a field are not themselves commendable absent any consistent training or guidance, as mentorship is an active, not passive, process, and the nations in question are either not prolific authors or do not have a stellar international reputation,

Observing that the &#147;removal of a one-org policy for the NPA&#148; is cited without elaboration as to how this improved the NPA or its military capabilities, or how it allowed future leaders to excel, disqualifying this argument as a worthy aspect of this commendation,

Rejecting the argument that Hulldom had anything to do with protecting Stargate or with navigating the region away from misfortune, as their initial portfolio was concerned with foreign affairs and not the region&#146;s military, no successful diplomatic agreements prevented the multiple attacks Stargate suffered during this period, and while Delegate of [region]The North Pacific[/region], they succumbed to outside extortion causing the region&#146;s foreign affairs to be compromised and become unstable following their resignation and the resignation of their successor, culminating in a brief invasion of their region and even more attacks on Stargate,

Repudiating the celebration of the creation of the Pax Polaris Occidens, which despite being a watershed moment in the ongoing relationship between the North and West Pacifics, was not itself a success for The North Pacific or its efforts to combat the Brotherhood of Malice (Malice) due to the New Pacific Order&#146;s (NPO) routine lack of enforcement of its provisions, rendering it a dead-letter agreement that was unceremoniously dissolved three years later,

Appalled that while serving a second time as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the North, Hulldom disclosed foreign affairs discussions from the North&#146;s intelligence apparatus related to NPO-driven peace talks between the North and Malice, to the NPO Senate in a vain attempt to prevent what they perceived to be an imminent collapse of those talks, causing a rift between the regions that would ultimately lead to the diplomatic disaster that destroyed the Pax Polaris Occidens&#146;s network over those regions&#146; handling of [region]The Outback[/region], and demonstrating greater loyalty to the NPO than to their own region, which they departed for the final time after resigning their post ahead of any possible trial; and that, to this day, they feel no remorse and maintain their actions were justified and the right thing to do, 

Concluding that everything highlighted beyond a series of World Assembly resolutions they authored and a law marginally improving the odds of nations gaining citizenship in The North Pacific is based on improper credit, did not pan out, or is meaningless due to their betrayal of the region their supposed exemplary service benefited,
