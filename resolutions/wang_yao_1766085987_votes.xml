<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

Remembering that in February 2015, this Council commended [nation]Evil Wolf[/nation] despite the nation&#39;s history of wanton disregard for the sovereignty of nations and regions alike, 

Questioning the resolution&#39;s admission that this nation would not normally be commendable, and disputing its narrative concession that the &quot;good done&quot; by Evil Wolf merits commendation,

Finding that many of Evil Wolf&#39;s deeds cannot be attributed to altruism, and that their own actions and conduct, which they have ratified as second Founder (and now Governor) of Lone Wolves United have unraveled any semblance of a commendable legacy,

Rebutting the commendable significance of Evil Wolf&#39;s role in combating Wickedly Evil People (Eli) in the West Pacific, as Eli has continued to be a staple of the West and served as a trusted interim Delegate on multiple occasions following Evil Wolf&#39;s opposition in the region (including as the second to hold the position following Rolheath),

Aghast that the target resolution cites Evil Wolf&#39;s service to Lazarus as commendable, since their actions threw the region into disarray and divided the native community. Most notably, in 2017, Evil Wolf participated as a core member of Funkadelia&#39;s coup, during which they:

[list][*]Engaged in rampant voter importation of raider and Rahl-aligned nations (later vindicated by 2020 public releases from The East Pacific&#39;s court) to destabilize the region, specifically as re-confirmation votes for Guardians and judicial offices approached,
[*]Framed various members of the native community as conspirators and traitors through selectively released and cut content, using this as a justification to consolidate control of the region,
[*]Aided in illegally dissolving the democratic Celestial Union government, ushering in the Undead Dominion, a dictatorship where its highest positions were filled by entryists affiliated with the couping parties,
[*]Directly expelled Amerion, a long-time native of Lazarus and several-time former Delegate, which would never return to the region from their exile imposed during the civil war,
[*]Supported the expulsions of other long-time natives, such as former Delegate and commended nation Harmoneia, and Doperland, the legal Vice Delegate of Lazarus at the time,[/list]

Disgusted that following the stabilization of the Undead Dominion and ostensible defeat of the Resistance, the region was declared the &#147;Khanate&#148; of Lazarus. At this stage, their coup abandoned any pretense of legitimacy and subjugated Lazarus to being a holding of Lone Wolves United, 

Noting that following the conclusion of the civil war, Evil Wolf was granted amnesty by the Lazarene government, in the interests of reconciliation. Despite this, they were recalled from their government posts for inactivity and later removed from the region for their participation in treacherous groups. Since, they have embarked on a campaign of consistent antagonism towards Lazarene officials,

Further concerned that Evil Wolf is one of the most prominent figures in Lone Wolves United. As the region&#39;s second Founder and Governor (retaining the official title Alpha Emeritus), they possess knowledge and access to the most intimate areas of the organization and have allowed their successors to run rampant in duplicity and subversion, such as,

[list][*]Involvement in the 2019 attempted coup of The East Pacific, where Scardino (as Fedele) expelled countless natives with the support of the Rahl family, and was recently reinstated as Khan of Lone Wolves United,
[*]Attempts to replace the legal Delegate of the Outback (while allied to the region), spearheaded by Alpha Emeritus A Bloodred Moon and Khan Tom, neither of which were disciplined by Evil Wolf as Founder for their actions,
[*]Agitating for the removal of government officials of Lone Wolves United&#39;s long-time treaty ally, the West Pacific, in an attempt to prevent the region from opposing their subversion in the Outback by destabilizing its foreign ministry,[/list]

Unmoved by Evil Wolf&#39;s consistent attempts at obfuscation and muddying the waters on their knowledge and participation in the aforementioned acts. Despite the claims of the nation, they have ratified the conduct and continue to be a steadfast advocate of Lone Wolves United and its harmful interests,

Concluding that taken as a whole, Evil Wolf&#39;s career represents an unrelenting hostility and disregard for liberty and peace across the multiverse, including in the Feeders and Sinkers, and that cherrypicked examples of varyingly important &quot;good&quot; do not supersede this reality,
