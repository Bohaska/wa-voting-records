<CREATED>1759335472</CREATED>
<DESC><![CDATA[Reaffirming, yet again, that resolutions which are superfluous and add nothing to international law by themselves should be repealed,

Knowing that, while GA#654 had good intentions, its goals were implemented in ways that are either useless by design, or which are extrinsically pointless in view of prior and standing international law,

Dismayed that Articles 1 and 2 are explicitly &quot;subject to the limitations of relevant international law, including that of the World Assembly,&quot; thereby reaffirming the WA&#39;s extremely broad authority to enact resolutions that could demand that member states cease particular modes of economic or political governance, micromanage how their civil servants and cabinet members are to be chosen, open or close their borders to particular groups of people, or refrain from having diplomatic relations with certain states [i]without their explicit consent[/i],

Convinced that Articles 3 and 4 are not useful or indeed necessary in light of GA#440 &quot;Administrative Compliance Act,&quot; which requires the WA (via its committees) to study allegations of noncompliance with its own resolutions, pursue and fine noncompliant member states as it sees fit, and impose tough sanctions on noncompliant members which refuse to pay these fines to be imposed by every other member state until such a time as they return to compliance,

Observing that while Article 5 is in principle [i]jus cogens[/i] (given that the World Assembly, by definition, enacts resolutions for the benefit of all of its members, not only some of them), it can be troublesome when considering that not all of the WA&#39;s roughly 17,000 members have an equal opportunity to implement their passed resolutions, whether in terms of physical, financial, or political constraints; for instance, such resolutions as GA#778 &quot;Virtual Mind Convention&quot; cannot be effectively implemented by member states with no conceivable access to electronic devices,

Deducing that none of the five Articles contained within the target resolution are useful or distinct additions to the canon of international law, but are instead restatements of the obvious or - in some cases - clear and obvious invitations for the WA to indulge in almost any violation of national sovereignty as it sees fit, and

Believing that the WA does not require any form of charter or foundational document, but rather a broad base of targeted laws which focus on the issues that matter most to nations and their leaders...

The General Assembly hereby repeals GA#654 &quot;The Civil Charter of the World Assembly.&quot;]]></DESC>
