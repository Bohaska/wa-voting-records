<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

[i]Recognizing[/i] East Malaysia (EM) as one of the ancient bastions of nation- and region-building within The East Pacific (TEP), maintaining an influential presence for over two decades and multiple government systems, from the Charter of The East Pacific to the Elders system and finally the modern Concordat,

[i]Praising[/i] EM&#146;s work during and after the Empire&#146;s invasion of TEP in 2008, submitting to the Empire a list of non-negotiable demands for peace and urging TEP natives to fight back against the occupying forces when they rejected the peace deal; EM&#146;s courage and leadership resulted in their election as one of the three Elders of TEP under the next government, where they largely served to stabilize the region and oversee the peaceful and democratic transition into the current regime,

[i]Observing[/i] EM&#146;s extensive and meaningful service within the government of The East Pacific as an Arbiter/Justice of the Conclave from 2013 to 2014, a legislator in 7 Magisterium terms dating back to 2009, a Minister and Adviser across 14 Delegate terms over 14 years, and most recently a Vizier for 6 consecutive years, one of the few to serve across all branches of government and the longest-serving government official in TEP history,

[i]Applauding[/i] EM&#146;s resistance to the attempted takeover of TEP in 2019, by serving as a member of the &#147;Small Magisterium Cafeterium,&#148; securing regional services and infrastructure for the legitimate government, and setting the regional legislative agenda for the days to follow, which paved the way for a burst of activity to rebuild and massively reform the government in response to the coup d&#146;&eacute;tat attempt,

[i]Extolling[/i] the massive protections of political rights introduced by EM in the Magisterium in 2021, which elevated the status of apolitical TEP non-citizen residents previously denied due process within the justice system and repaired the relationship between the government and some of the disillusioned governed, further unifying the community and uprooting the seeds of division planted by the would-be despots of the 2019 coup attempt,

[i]Celebrating[/i] EM&#146;s initiative in operating the Eastern Pacific News Service (EPNS) in 2020 and again in 2024, in the absence of a Minister, drawing from past experience to keep the newspaper from falling into disarray and expand its representation of the Urth and Valsora communities, especially with the Worlds to Build section of the EPNS,

[i]Lauding[/i] EM&#146;s inception of the Support The East Pacific project in 2021, an ongoing program whereby new residents are acclimated to TEP&#146;s institutions and community, which were the first official guides to be produced by the government in collaboration with the Valsora and Urth subcommunities,

[i]Acknowledging[/i] over 20 years of administrative service on EM&#146;s part in the background of TEP, developing dispatch information systems and templates, official regional branding, and new technologies, such as automated systems for regional interface and task organization, as well as having run all regional services and community spaces, which they have continuously adapted to evolving community needs,

[i]Honoring[/i] the creation and constant maintenance of TepWiki and its sister platform ValsoraWiki by EM, two online encyclopedias collectively holding over 4,000 published articles describing and recording the worlds of Urth and Valsora, respectively, which has enabled the documentation of thousands of years of history from diverse nations in TEP including over a dozen articles by EM themselves on alliances, companies, countries, and more,

[i]Appreciating[/i] EM&#146;s further, specific contributions to the documentation of Urth history, such as in 2019, with the inception of the first-ever time-zones map in TEP, as well as the development of a master list of Urth&#146;s languages and religions, as well as an evolutionary tree, TepWiki article, and population spreadsheet for Urth species, building upon old, abandoned archives to expand access to information globally,

[i]Admiring[/i] the rich, island culture of the Free Pax States, the Urthian name for East Malaysia, stemming from the diversity of the multi-species nation, known for its rice-based cuisine, history of scientific and philosophical advancement, and the worship of the ancient panther god Mun, a god also venerated in the globe-spanning Yuserist religion as a fallen god of creation,

[i]Lionizing[/i] the extensive documentation of the uniquely constructed language of Kilumi, the language of the Free Pax States, with its flowing phonemes and artistic calligraphy unlike any other seen on Urth or throughout the multiverse, and

[i]Believing[/i] the actions of EM and their effect on TEP to have invariably altered the course of East Pacifican and Urthian history and positively affected the region&#146;s residents again and again for years past and years to come,
