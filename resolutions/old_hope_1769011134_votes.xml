<DESC><![CDATA[The World Assembly, 

Aware that:
[list][*]The Pacific, as a Feeder, is a key region; a lot of nations are founded in it regularly.
[*]The Pacific has been administrated by the system of New Pacific Order for more than 15 years, [/list]

Recalling the past of the New Pacific Order(NPO):
[list][*]Its violent founding by the nation [nation]Francos Spain[/nation], which couped the region and established its highly authoritarian system, with the Delegate nation basically having supreme power over everything and ruling as a tyrannic nation,
[*]Its continued attempts to take over other regions, including key regions, previously under the guise of the hideous ideology of Francoism(that called for the dismantling of all non-key regions), which lead to destabilizations such as [region]Lazarus[/region], which, after ousting the New Lazarene Order and being destabilized soon fell prey to Lone Wolves United and the Undead Dominion, a period of time in which nations spawning in it were subjected to a region in a desolate state with a tyrannical delegate nation for a long time,
[*]Its willingness to covertly work with nations that have shown reprehensible conduct,
[*]The two condemnations for the Pacific, both repealed in the hope that The Pacific had changed its ways,[/list]
Disturbed to find that the New Pacific Order has, in fact, not changed its ways:
[list][*]The NPO once signed a treaty acknowledging the legitimate governance of [region]The Outback[/region]
[*]The NPO, along with [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] and the Augustin Alliance, attempted to install a nation as a puppet delegate, which only failed because that nation refused and left,
[*]The installation of a puppet would have likely resulted in another key region not functioning properly, in a similar manner to Lazarus,
[*]The NPO then lied about their involvement and tried to cover things up; However, it has been shown that the World Assembly Delegate nation was involved in this coup attempt,
[*]The NPOs callous treatment of nations and regions associated with it, such as the region [region]Starlight[/region], which they only attempted to bring into their influence to use as a tool, the nation [nation]A Mean Old Man[/nation], a previous key co-conspirator in the Lazarus coup, which was described in unflattering terms and again attempted to be used as a tool,[/list]

Enraged that the NPO continues to have diplomatic relations with [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], a condemned region which has shown similar conduct,

Dismayed that the NPO is continuing to instill its terrible [i]values[/i] in nations that are founded in The Pacific,

Ashamed to have been fooled to trust the New Pacific Order another time, 

Knowing that, at this stage, The Pacific is nearly indistinguishable from the New Pacific Order,

Saddened that the destruction of the New Pacific Order is extremely difficult,

Hoping to encourage decent nations to leave the Pacific, and to encourage decent regions from severing all diplomatic ties to the New Pacific Order,
