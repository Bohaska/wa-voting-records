In a multiverse regrettably filled with many thousands of regions that have fallen into inactivity, there have existed millions of nations that were once inhabitants. One such nation amongst the masses, [nation]New United Common-lands[/nation], has lived a story so radiant that it serves as an illuminating beacon of hope,

[i]Recalling[/i] the genesis of [nation]New United Common-lands[/nation] (NUCL), which entered the multiverse in April 2020 and settling in a small, but rapidly growing region called [region]The Region That Has No Big Banks[/region] (NBB); with NUCL seeing the enormous potential in NBB during its recovery from years of inactivity, they capitalized on the spark of life in the region and became determined to carry it through those hard times, leading the way into a new, brighter future; Through NUCL&#146;s tireless work and the foundations they fostered as a result, they largely architected the basis for which modern NBB is built,

[i]Noting[/i] with awe that during their tenure, NUCL shone in a plethora of governmental positions, notably serving as Election Administrator, Deputy Prime Minister, WA Delegate, 3x Elected Prime Minister, 3x Appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Commissar General of the Bankless Liberation Forces, and Minister of Events, the culmination of which was receiving community recognition, with them being awarded the highest civilian title of Honorary Founder of NBB, by Prime Minister [nation]America the Greater[/nation], in January 2024,

[i]Extolling[/i] their spectacular efforts, whilst working alongside Founder [nation]Yodle[/nation], to wholesale restructure the regional and governmental apparatus to modernize NBB, with major contributions including:
[list]
[*]Comprehensively reinstituting key governmental pillars in NBB, first by kickstarting and facilitating the first Elections in NBB&#146;s modern era, then by breathing life into the Executive Branch through the implementation of government departments and single-handedly rallying motivated natives to contribute their efforts, and finally by reorganizing the Legislative Branch through the creation and management of Parliament, which later led to the planning and implementation of a Constitution as NBB grew;
[*]Authoring and co-authoring a total of forty-three bills in the Parliament, becoming one of NBB&#146;s most prolific legislators of all time. Some notable bills were the Defendership Accords, the Establishment of the Bankless Liberation Forces, the Dual Citizenship Act, the Referendum and Petition Bill, and the Election Procedure Bill;
[*]Reviving NBB&#146;s newspaper, The Social Reformer, after a five-year dormancy and continuing to revise and improve on each edition during their tenure, publishing five between 2022-2025 and contributing to eleven other editions in the same time period;[/list]
[i]Admiring[/i] that, following NUCL&#146;s retirement as WA Delegate of NBB in August 2023, they took the opportunity to establish a Defender-aligned force called [i]The Bankless Liberation Forces[/i] (BLF), taking the helm as the first Commissar General and leading participation in operations alongside a growing number of allies, and establishing a training regimen and internal recruitment efforts which grew the size of the BLF;

[i]Revering[/i] NUCL&#146;s accomplishments during their tenure as Minister of Foreign Affairs, ushering NBB into a golden age of diplomacy and expansion, culminating in two landmark bilateral treaties, including: [i]The Money Heist Accords[/i], signed in September 2024 with [region]The East Pacific[/region], a cultural and mutual defense treaty that was notable as it marked the close ties with NBB&#146;s oldest ally in the Pacifics; and [i]The Accord of the Bankless Arboretum[/i], signed in October 2024 with [region]Forest[/region], a cultural treaty that sought to formalize deep pre-existing connections between both communities dating back several years;

[i]Impressed[/i] by the unparalleled impact that NUCL had in shaping the cultural development of NBB, in particular, the numerous festivals that they established, some examples include:
[list]
[*]12 Days of No Big Banks, an annual winter festival featuring twelve days of unique cultural events, media, and activities, usually occurring in the lead up to Christmas;
[*]Summer Fest, an annual summer festival that features a wide selection of cultural events and scheduled gatherings for a wide variety of interests;
[*]Summer Slowdown, a late summer festival that was held in 2025, aimed to slow down government activity due to burnout and promote mental health awareness and connection with nature;
[*]Bankless Forest Chess Events, two bilateral chess competitions hosted by both NBB and [region]Forest[/region] in 2024, with participation from numerous other communities,[/list]

[i]Asserting[/i] that NUCL&#146;s years of dedicated service to the continual betterment of NBB after jumpstarting its modern era have proven extraordinarily fruitful, ushering in unprecedented expansion and creating the foundations of a culturally rich, ever-growing community that has built deep cultural connections across the multiverse,
