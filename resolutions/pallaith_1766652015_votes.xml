<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

Finally acknowledging the heroism of [nation]Great Bights Mum[/nation] (GBM), a paragon of freedom and forgiveness, and a river to their people;

Recognizing their essential role in combating most of the coups d&#39;&eacute;tat throughout the history of [region]The North Pacific[/region] (TNP), including:

[list][*]Great Bight&#146;s takeover, when the weak leadership of TNP was unable to assert itself, forcing stalwarts like [nation]Flemingovia[/nation], [nation]Former English Colony[/nation], and GBM to fight back after being ejected from their home with repeated public counter-propaganda and charisma, exemplified by GBM&#146;s legendary transition into a matronly haven for the disapproving mothers of the pirates of Great Bight, an entertaining yet symbolic identity that the tyrant nation could not bring itself to purge, allowing GBM to successfully disarm them as a force of fear and galvanize the resistance into the Puppetmaster operation, which they maintain to this day as a permanent reminder of this crucial victory;

[*]Pixiedance&#146;s reign of terror, the longest period of rogue delegate control, when most in TNP despaired of any hope of toppling the usurpers, and only through sheer force of will and unflinching determination to keep hope alive were nations like GBM able to keep the community in exile focused on reclaiming their region; and thanks to GBM&#146;s tireless efforts in directing nations to the true TNP community forum and knack for winning the loyalty and respect of the nations working with the Underground, they proved a more reliable and steadfast bloc compared to the chaos that eventually caused Pixiedance to lose their hold on the region;

[*]The deception of [nation]Dalimbar[/nation], known then as Chodean Kal, a legitimately elected delegate that threw out democracy in lieu of their more enlightened and benevolent rule, but whose damage was mitigated in large part by GBM&#146;s insistence on maintaining consistent dialogue and adopting many of the desired reforms and corrections fueling Dalimbar&#146;s suspension of democracy, culminating in their decision to step down and hand power back to GBM;

[*]The cleaving of [nation]Westwind[/nation]&#146;s Crimson Order (operating under the guise of Lewis and Clark), the greatest challenge faced by the region since Pixiedance and the one most requiring GBM&#146;s intervention as appointed vice delegate and as the recognized head of the government-in-waiting; and as before, GBM&#146;s superior rallying of the loyal community, outreach to other nations making them an impossible-to-remove target of the regime, and better diplomatic appeal to key nations including former Lexicon agent [nation]Eluvatar[/nation] and even Gates, leader of the supporting piling army backing the regime, caused the so-called Crimson King to cut too deeply into their influence in trying to reduce GBM&#146;s support and ultimately surrender the region back to GBM;[/list]

Impressed by GBM&#146;s moderating influence in the many constitutional conventions in the wake of these coups, especially the one following Pixiedance&#146;s coup, which guaranteed TNP&#146;s interests and democratic principles would remain central to any reform and guided regional leaders in resisting outside influence including from organizations that assisted in TNP&#146;s liberation;

Recognizing the quiet and stabilizing periods during which GBM served as TNP&#146;s fifth, seventh, and ninth elected delegate, during which they became the first delegate to serve as head of government, repeatedly refused calls to serve longer and with greater authority, and used their elevated station to offer amnesty and forgiveness to those who supported the same villains they succeeded, even allowing disgraced delegates to maintain a presence in the community years later, including Dalimbar&#146;s brief and respectful return as an elected delegate and later justice; and in so doing, guaranteeing that after the coups were defeated, the region would not splinter again as easily;

Highlighting their pioneering presence in the region&#146;s eventual Security Council, the primary security apparatus meant to respond to and guard against future coups like those they previously combatted, a role they have continuously held from its inception to the current day; and with their successful institution of a consensus-based model of executing its duties rather than the usual hierarchy, allowing it to remain a successful collegiate body devoid of internal strife which would undermine its crucial role;

Unsurprised that GBM&#146;s role as the maternal moral center of the community extended to serving as administrator through every iteration of the community&#146;s regional forum, and that they remain a source of wisdom and guardian of regional and international history as such sources dwindle;

In awe of their decades of unwavering commitment, guidance, and unflinching belief in democracy and self-determination, and recognizing how rare and precious such stalwart champions are;
